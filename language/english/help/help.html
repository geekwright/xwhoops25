<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    xWhoops provides extended error messages for XOOPS using <a href="https://github.com/filp/whoops" class="external">whoops</a>.
    It is primarily intended for developers.
</p>
<p>
    xWhoops messages are only available to user groups that the administrator has <em>selected</em>,
    so on failure, messages can safely be much more informative and detailed.
</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>
    When an error occurs, xWhoops will display a screen with information about the error.
    <br>
    The Whoops display contains 4 main sections.
    <ul>
    <li><em>top left</em> is the error that was encountered</li>
    <li><em>lower left</em> shows the stack frames, the trace of path of the processing that resulted in the error.</li>
    <li><em>top right</em> shows the code for the currently selected stack frame item. Select a new stack frame to see the related code.</li>
    <li><em>lower right</em> shows environment information such as request parameters, session information, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    Note: if the XoopsLogger is enabled, MySQL queries will be shown in the Environment & details section.
